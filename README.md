# Virtual care

### VirtualCare is a telemedicine web application that enables patients to receive medical care from anywhere in the world. Through video conferencing, the app links patients with authorized healthcare professionals so that they can receive consultations, diagnoses, and treatment plans at home. In order to help doctors make treatment decisions, VirtualCare also enables patients to communicate with their healthcare providers about their medical information, including test results and vital signs.
